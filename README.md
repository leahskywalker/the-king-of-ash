Since I'm so new to coding, this is where I'll be adding notes in order to help me document and notate more global/universal things as I come across them. This will also help indicate my thought process behind some of the overall organization and code logic.

Scripts that define classes (class_name) will be capitalized. Eg: Character.gd
Constants (const) will be all caps. Eg: const CHARACTER_DETAILS
